//Write a program that asks you for a word then shows its length, lowercase and uppercase values.
let word = prompt("Enter a word: ")

//Improve the previous program so that it also shows the number of vowels inside the word.

//Improve the previousprogram to check if the word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or sentence thatâ€™s spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. Punctuation and spacing may not be taken into account here.
//"radar" should be detected as a palindrome, "Radar" too.
