/*You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.

Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated from name and surname.

For instance:

let john = { name: "John", surname: "Smith", id: 1 };
let pete = { name: "Pete", surname: "Hunt", id: 2 };
let mary = { name: "Mary", surname: "Key", id: 3 };

let users = [ john, pete, mary ];

let usersMapped = users.map(item => item.name)


usersMapped = [
  { fullName: "John Smith", id: 1 },
  { fullName: "Pete Hunt", id: 2 },
  { fullName: "Mary Key", id: 3 }
]


alert( usersMapped[0].id ) // 1
alert( usersMapped[0].fullName ) // John Smith
//So, actually you need to map one array of objects to another. Try using => here. Thereâ€™s a small catch.





/*let john = { name: "John", age: 25 };
let pete = { name: "Pete", age: 30 };
let mary = { name: "Mary", age: 28 };

let users = [ john, pete, mary ];

let names = users.map(item => item.name);

alert( names ); // John, Pete, Mary
